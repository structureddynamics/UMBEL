The collection can be more precisely defined as follows: Each AbstractInformationStructure is such that each of its physical instantiations (see instantiationOfAIS) consists of instantiations of instances of AtomicSymbol_Abstract, arranged in a certain way. For example, the abstract sentence 'The pig flies' is an AbstractInformationStructure. Each written instantiation of it consists of an instantiation of the words (symbols) 'The', 'pig' and 'flies', written in that order. (If the AbstractInformationStructure 'The pig flies' were spoken, the same words would appear in the same order, i.e. 'The' first, etc., but the sequence would be determined by the arrangement of the spoken words in time, rather than space.) Likewise with abstract diagrams, graphs, etc. Each of these is such that its physical instantiations consist of arrangements of instantiations of instances of AtomicSymbol_Abstract. A hard copy of a wiring diagram consists of a group of concrete symbols representing various circuit components, in which these symbols are spatially arranged in a certain in way. The arrangement of the concrete symbols in an instantiation of an AbstractInformationStructure is not always a simple matter of arrangement in space or time. The sequence of symbols '0010010111011001' can be instantiated in written, spoken, or electronic forms.

Each Collection is a kind or type of thing whose instances share a certain property, attribute, or feature.  For example, Cat is the collection of all and only cats, and BinaryFunction is the collection of all and only functions taking two arguments.
<p/>
The notion of collection is fundamental to the Cyc ontology, and is thus difficult to define in a precise and substantive way.  But it is instructive to compare it to the mathematical notion of a set (see Set_Mathematical).  Like a set, a collection is an AbstractThing (i.e. aspatial and atemporal) that is not an Individual (cf.), but instead has elements (see elementOf).  Unlike a set, however, the elements or &quot;instances&quot; (see isa) of a given collection can vary from context to context, and it is possible for distinct collections to have exactly the same elements (i.e. to have the same extent) with respect to a given context. For example, the (non-reified) collections &quot;Chordate&quot; and &quot;Renate&quot; are co-extensional in the context of the present-day actual world, but have differring extents with respect to hypothetical contexts in which there exist creatures having hearts but not kidneys.  This difference is sometimes summarized by saying that sets are &quot;extensional&quot; things and collections are &quot;intensional&quot; things.
<p/>
Many, though by no means all, of the collections reified in the Cyc ontology correspond to natural kinds or classes.  It is particulary useful to reify collections that are difficult to define precisely, but about which there are many common-sense rules and other things to state.  For example, it would not be worthwile to introduce a constant 'WhiteCat', both because it's easy to define the collection of white cats in terms of more general, already-reified notions (e.g. '(CollectionIntersection2Fn Cat WhiteColor)'), and because there's not much to say about that particular collection.  WhiteCollarWorker, on the other hand, is a good collection to have reified, as it is hard to define precisely, yet is a collection about which there are many things to say.
<p/>
Some of the many reified specializations of Collection are FirstOrderCollection, TimeDependentCollection, and ObjectType."""@en ;

Each instance of Communicating is an event in which the transfer of information between or among agents is a focal action; communicating is the main purpose and/or goal in the event.  That may be contrasted with events which involve communication but wherein the focus is different, e.g., playing cards (wherein the progressive actions -- and winning -- of the game are focal).  Since Communicating is a specialization of PurposefulAction, each Communicating event must be intentional on the part of the communicatorOfInfo; it may or may not be intentional on the part of the agent playing the infoCommunicatedTo role.  Hence, a speaker on a soapbox haranguing an indifferent crowd is performing an instance of Communicating.  In contrast, Juliet soliloquizing on her balcony, unaware that Romeo is listening to her, is not Communicating; rather Romeo (and Juliet, unaware) are engaged in an Eavesdropping. Communicating may be either a one-way or a two-way transfer of information (cf. CommunicationAct_Single, MultiDirectionalCommunication).  Every event belonging to Communicating contains at least one transfer of information between at least two agents who participate in the event.  (Note that the latter requirement excludes reading and writing from Communicating, when those events are just the private accessing or generating of information.)  Communicating may be specialized in various ways, such as, by the method or medium used (e.g., AudioCommunicating, NonVerbalCommunicating, FaceToFacePresenceCommunicating); by the type of information involved (e.g., MakingAnAgreement); by the purpose of the communication (e.g., Teaching, Negotiating); by the agents involved (e.g., IntraOrganizationCommunication, StageProduction).  Examples of Communicating include a symphony performance, an email message, a telephone call, a speech, a handshake, issuing a traffic ticket -- all of which normally, and focally, involve communication between two or more agents."""@en ;

By contrast, winning a prize is an instantaneous change: up to the moment the event takes place, you don't have the prize, after that you do. Granted, the awarding of the prize might in fact have a physical duration, but from a conceptual or logical point of view it might as well have none. If one thinks of events as the occurrence of &quot;changes&quot;, one may regard durative events as changes that intrinsically occupy a continuous, non-zero chunk of time, and non-durative events (for which see PunctualEventType) as instantaneous changes. CumulativeEventType is a proper specialization of this collection, because the cumulativity property (see the salient assertion for CumulativeEventType) implies that all process types can have temporal extension.

  a ac:Functions_Fundamental_Topic ;
  skos:definition """A specialization of Relation (q.v.) and the collection of all functions.  Each instance of Function_Denotational is a many-one relation that represents, with respect to any given context, a mapping from one set of things (the function's relationDomain) to another set of things (its relationRange).  As a many-one relation, a function maps each thing in its domain to exactly one thing in its range.  A function might be unary, binary, ternary, etc. (see arity; but cf. relationalArity), depending on whether the members of its domain are singletons, ordered pairs, ordered triples, etc.  In general, the domain of an N-ary function with respect to a given context is a set of ordered N-tuples (construed in CycL as Lists of length N).  The function is said to take the items from any of these N-tuples as its N <i>arguments</i> and to return a member of its range as its corresponding <i>value</i> (see valueOfFunctionForArgs).  There are also functions that are not of any particular fixed arity; see VariableArityFunction.
<p/>
For example, GovernmentFn is the unary function that takes each GeopoliticalEntity to its RegionalGovernment, and PlusFn is the variable-arity function that takes any sequence of two or more ScalarIntervals
(q.v.) to their arithmetic sum.
<p/>
Note that the domain and range (i.e. the extension) of a given function might vary from context to context.  For example, as the government of a country can change over time, GovernmentFn will in such cases map the same country to different governments with respect to different times.  Thus, an instance of Function_Denotational is closer to what is sometimes called a &quot;function-in-intension&quot; than to the purely set-theoretical notion of a &quot;function-in-extension&quot;.
<p/>
CycL terms that denote functions can be used to form non-atomic terms (or &quot;NATs&quot;; see CycLClosedNonAtomicTerm).  Specifically, when such a function-denoting expression is appropriately combined with other expressions (i.e. the former is in the 0th argument position and the latter are of the correct number and type) the resulting expression is a new CycL term (a NAT) that may then freely appear as a component in other CycL expressions.  The NAT will itself denote the value (if any) of the function denoted by the former expression for the sequence of arguments denoted, respectively, by the latter expressions.  For example, GovernmentFn is a unary function, and so the CycL constant 'GovernmentFn' requires one syntactic argument (such as the constant 'France') to form a NAT (in this case, the expression '(<a href=http://sw.openc 0     pp        A specialization of Algorithm.

Note that instances of GeographicalAgent are viewed in two significantly different ways with respect to two different types of geography-related microtheories.

Each instance of InformationBearingThing (or &quot;IBT&quot;) is an  item that contains information (for an agent who knows how to interpret it).   Examples: a copy of the novel <i>Moby Dick</i>; a signal buoy; a photograph; an  elevator sign in Braille; a map; a US dollar bill; a resume; a musical score;  copies of the CycProgram.
<p/>
For representations of the propositional content  of information bearing things, see PropositionalInformationThing; but note  that not all IBTs have a propositional content (cf. ArtObject).  An important specialization of InformationBearingThing is InformationBearingObject,  which comprises all of those IBTs that are also physical objects (i.e.  PartiallyTangibles).  Though often a subtle task in particular contexts,  it is important to distinguish the various specializations of  InformationBearingThing from those of AspatialInformationStore (whose  instances are the chunks of information instantiated in particular IBTs;  see instantiationOfAIT) and from those of ConceptualWork (whose  instances are the conceptual or artistic creations that are instantiated  in particular IBTs; see instantiationOfWork).
<p/>
For instance, TextString  is a specialization of AspatialInformationStore, TextualMaterial is  a specialization of InformationBearingThing, and TextualPCW is a  specialization of ConceptualWork; to conflate any of these with  another would be to make a &quot;category error&quot;.  Also note that events  in which information is transferred (see InformationTransferEvent) are  not considered instances of InformationBearingThing.  Rather, such  transfer events have as one of their participants (see actors) some  instance of InformationBearingThing; though in cases where IBTs are  themselves events this will require distinguishing very finely between  the event that encodes the information and the event that is the information transfer.

ac:ObjectType a umbel:AbstractConcept ;
  a owl:Class ;
  skos:definition """The collection of all collections that are &quot;object-like&quot; in at least one respect. A collection <code><b>COL</b></code> is object-like just in case there is some sense of 'part' according to which any (or nearly any) given proper part of an instance of <code><b>COL</b></code> is <i>not</i> itself an instance of <code><b>COL</b></code>; when this happens <code><b>COL</b></code> is said to be object-like with respect to that sense of 'part'.
<p/>
More precisely, for a collection <code><b>COL</b></code> to be an instance of ObjectType it is sufficient that there be some specialization <code><b>PARTPRED</b></code> of properParts such that, for any <code><b>OBJ1</b></code> and <code><b>OBJ2</b></code>, if <code>(isa <b>OBJ1</b> <b>COL</b>)</code> and <code>(<b>PARTPRED</b> <b>OBJ1</b> <b>OBJ2</b>)</code> both hold, then <code>(isa <b>OBJ2</b> <b>COL</b>)</code> does <i>not</i> hold.  (Also sufficient for <code><b>COL</b></code>'s being an object-type is that there be some specialization <code><b>INVPARTPRED</b></code> of the <i>inverse</i> of properParts (see genlInverse) such that <code>(<b>INVPARTPRED</b> <b>OBJ2</b> <b>OBJ1</b>)</code>, with everything else remaining the same as above.)  Note that neither of the above sufficient conditions for <code><b>COL</b></code>'s being an object-type is strictly necessary: some exceptions are allowed.  Thus as long as either one of the above conditionals holds in <i>nearly</i> all cases, <code><b>COL</b></code> should be considered an instance of ObjectType.
<p/>
Here are two examples.  Consider Automobile.  Take an instance of that, say my car.  Now consider one of the proper physicalParts of my car, say the steering wheel.  The steering wheel is <i>not</i> an instance of Automobile.  And the same would be true for any proper physical part of any car.  So Automobile is an ObjectType.  Consider CalendarYear. No proper timeSlices of a year is itself a year.  So CalendarYear is an ObjectType.

Each instance of the collection Obligation is specification of what some agent (related to the obligation via obligatedAgents (q.v.)) is obliged to do, or make true, for one or more other agents or possibly 'for' society in general.  An obligation is the most general case of some agent owing something to another.  Obligations may be undertaken in conjunction with various kinds of Agreements.   Unlike an agreement, however, an obligation need not have a second known party (though some do).  An obligation can exist and be understood without identifying another particular agent as the 'holder' of the obligation -- and that may be true, even if the beneficiary (obligationOwedTo) can be identified.  For example, assuming that parents have an obligation to care for their children, it is not clear with whom a parent has 'agreed' to take care of his or her child.  Some common ways to incur an obligation are through social transactions (e.g. family duties, friendship, favors) or through financial transactions (e.g. a PaymentObligation).   In addition, obligations may be imposed on those who are subject to one or more instances of CodeOfConduct, e.g. SportsRulesOf_BoxingSportsEvent or OfficeCodeOfConduct."""@en ;

For many instances of PortableObject, portability is important for the fulfillment of their primary functions;  for example, an article of clothing (an instance of SomethingToWear),  a hand-guided tool (an instance of HandTool), a coin or dollar bill (an instance of Currency), or a flashlight (an instance of Flashlight) would be pretty useless if they weren't portable.

Note that Tool is not a subcollection of PortableObject, since many tools are heavy and/or stationary.  A borderline example of a PortableObject would be a heart/lung machine; although the beneficiary of its primary function is in no position to move it around, the physicians and nurses who also are &quot;using&quot; it can and do exactly that.  The same goes for a playpen; the kids in it had better <i>not</i> be able to move it around, but the adults who set it up and put them there can and do move it.   A borderline non-example would be a car; even though its user can make it move around, that is more a controlling action than a transporting action -- i.e., the car is doing the transporting in that case, not the driver.  A borderline example is a cat; even though it moves under its own power, it is light enough for its owner to pick it up and move it around.

Non-examples include Bread, since not all bread is produced to be sold (think &quot;home-made&quot;); but its subcollection (ProductFn Bread) is a product-type.  On the other hand, there are some microtheoretic contexts whose domain assumptions are such that collections whose instances are _commonly_ (but not exclusively) sold as products (e.g. Bread, DairyProduct) count as ProductTypes in those contexts; BuyingMt and BrandNameProductGMt are two such contexts.  Note that ProductType is not a subcollection of either ObjectType or StuffType, because some product-types are of one but not the other of these kinds (e.g. Ketchup is a StuffType but not an ObjectType).  Also note that not every conceivable subcollection of Product constitutes a ProductType; only those subcollections that correspond (in some broad sense) to categories under which products are produced, bought, or sold should be product-types.

Something is an instance of SetOrCollection just in case it is a collection (i.e. an instance of Collection) or a mathematical set (i.e. an instance of Set_Mathematical).  Instances of Set_Mathematical and instances of Collection (and thus instances of SetOrCollection) share some basic common features.  All instances of Collection and all instances of Set_Mathematical (and thus all instances of SetOrCollection) are abstract entities, lacking spatial and temporal properties.  Nearly all instances of Collection (except &quot;empty&quot; collections) and nearly all instances of Set_Mathematical (except the empty set; see TheEmptySet) have &quot;elements&quot; (i.e. instances or members; see elementOf); hence set-or-collections may stand to one another in generalized set-theoretic relations such as subsetOf and disjointWith (qq.v.).  (It is this shared feature of having elements that provides the basic rationale for reifying the collection SetOrCollection.)  Nevertheless, sets and collections differ in two important ways.  First, each collection is intrinsically associated with an intensional criterion for membership -- a more or less natural property (or group of properties) possessed by all of (and only) its elements.  Collections are thus akin to kinds.  In contrast, the elements of a set are not required to be homogeneous in any respect: any things whatsoever may together constitute the elements of a set.  The second major difference between sets and collections is that no two distinct sets can be coextensional (i.e. have exactly the same elements; see coExtensional).  Sets can thus be identified purely on the basis of their extensions (see extent).  Collections, on the other hand, are individuated by their intensional criteria for membership.  So collections that have exactly the same elements might nevertheless be distinct, differing in their respective membership criteria.  (Note that the general relationship between collections and their &quot;intensional criteria for membership&quot; in the above sense is not something that is currently represented explicitly in the Knowledge Base (though this seems a worthwhile area for future work); still the comment and other &quot;definitional&quot; assertions on a given collection should ideally convey a reasonably clear and precise idea of its associated membership criterion.)"""@en ;
