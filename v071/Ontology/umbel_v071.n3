Note in other systems or ontologies, similar constructs may alternatively be called topics, subjects, concepts or perhaps interests. UMBEL has adopted the term subject concept to distinguish from these uses, which have different nuances of meaning and use, as well as to highlight the subject or topic nature of UMBELís concrete concepts.

All subject concepts are a class and while they have a preferred label (using SKOS terminology), they are representative or a proxy for that concept, and not to be confused with the thing itself. Every UMBEL subject concept can be expressed and referred to by a different preferred label in alternate languages. Indeed, in a given language, different preferred labels may be swapped out without affecting the identity or use of the subject concept itself. The name for a subject concept is therefore merely a handle.

Subject concepts are the core constituents to the UMBEL framework. All subject concepts are based on existing concepts in OpenCyc, the open source version of the Cyc knowledge base.

About 21,000 of them have been distilled and are part of the UMBEL backbone."""@en ;

Similar to "topics" or "subjects", these other terms are used in somewhat different ways in specific in alternative schemas and are therefore not used interchangeably here (10) These are not abstract (truth, beauty, evil) concepts, but concrete about kinds of things or ideas in the real world; abstract concepts are often properly part of what are known as "upper ontologies"."""@en ;
